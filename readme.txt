Retrieving Geo-Information using the Maxmind GeoIP (Lite) Database.

== Description ==

Provides geographic information detected by an IP adress. This can be used in themes or other plugins, or via CSS body classes.

= Features: =

* Provides 3 functions: 
  * `geoip_detect_get_info_from_ip($ip)`: Lookup Geo-Information of the specified IP 
  * `geoip_detect_get_info_from_current_ip()`: Lookup Geo-Information of the current website user
  * `geoip_detect_get_external_ip_adress()`: Fetch the internet adress of the webserver
* Auto-Update the GeoIP database once a week
* For the property names, see the results of a specific IP in the wordpress backend (under Tools > GeoIP Detection).
* You can include these properties into your posts and pages by using the shortcode `[geoip_detect property="country_name" default="(country could not be detected)"]` (where 'country_name' can be one of the other property names as well, and 'default' can be used (optionally) to show a different text when no information was found for this IP).
* When enabled on the plugin page, it adds CSS classes to the body tag such as `geoip-country-DE` and `geoip-continent-EU`.

= How can I use these functions? =

* You could choose the currency of the store based on the country name
* You could suggest an timezone to use when displaying dates
* You could show the store nearest to your customer
* You show or hide content specific to a geographic target group
* Etc. ... You tell me! I'm rather curious what you'll do with this plugin!

*This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com.*

== Installation ==

This plugin does not contain the database itself. It is downloaded as soon as you activate it the first time (takes some seconds).
You can try it out on the plugin page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How exact is this data? =

Think of it as an "educated guess": IP adresses and their allocation change on a frequent basis.
If you need [more exact data](http://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite_city_accuracy "GeoLiteCity Accuracy"), consider purchasing the commercial version of the data.

= Technically speaking, how could I verify if my visitor comes from Germany? =

Put this code somewhere in your template files:

    $userInfo = geoip_detect_get_info_from_current_ip();
    if ($userInfo && $userInfo->country_code == 'DE')
        echo 'Hallo! SchÃ¶n dass Sie hier sind!';

Or, add the plugin shortcode somewhere in the page or post content:

    Heyo, over there in [geoip_detect property="country_name"] !
   
To see which property names are supported, refer to the [Plugin Backend](http://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/screenshots/).

#### What is planned to be implemented? ####

Maxmind released a new API version (v2) with localized country names and a accuracy percentage. Work in Progress.
