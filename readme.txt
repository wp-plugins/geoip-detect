Retrieving Geo-Information using the Maxmind GeoIP (Lite) Database.

== Description ==

Provides geographic information detected by an IP adress. This can be used in themes or other plugins, or via CSS body classes.

= Features: =

* Provides 3 functions: 
  * `geoip_detect_get_info_from_ip($ip)`: Lookup Geo-Information of the specified IP 
  * `geoip_detect_get_info_from_current_ip()`: Lookup Geo-Information of the current website user
  * `geoip_detect_get_external_ip_adress()`: Fetch the internet adress of the webserver
* Auto-Update the GeoIP database once a week
* For the property names, see the results of a specific IP in the wordpress backend (under Tools > GeoIP Detection).
* You can include these properties into your posts and pages by using the shortcode `[geoip_detect property="country_name"]` (where 'country_name' can be one of the other property names as well).
* When enabled on the plugin page, it adds CSS classes to the body tag such as `geoip-country-DE` and `geoip-continent-EU`.

= How can I use these functions? =

* You could choose the currency of the store based on the country name
* You could suggest an timezone to use when displaying dates
* You could show the store nearest to your customer
* Etc. ... You tell me! I'm rather curious what you'll do with this plugin!

*This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com.*

== Installation ==

This plugin does not contain the database itself, so it has to be loaded before first use.
2 alternative ways of doing this:

= Automatic Installation =

Go to Tools > GeoIP Detect and click on the button `"Update now"`.
The database is written into the `/uploads`-Folder.

= Manual Installation =

1. Download the database at http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
2. extract it and 
3. put it into the plugin directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How exact is this data? =

Think of it as an "educated guess": IP adresses and their allocation change on a frequent basis.
If you need [more exact data](http://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite_city_accuracy "GeoLiteCity Accuracy"), consider purchasing the commercial version of the data.

= Technically speaking, how could I verify if my visitor comes from Germany? =

Put this code somewhere in your template files:

    $userInfo = geoip_detect_get_info_from_current_ip();
    if ($userInfo && $userInfo->country_code == 'DE')
        echo 'Hallo! SchÃ¶n dass Sie hier sind!';

Or, add the plugin shortcode somewhere in the page or post content:

    Heyo, over there in [geoip_detect property="country_name"] !
   
To see which property names are supported, refer to the [Plugin Backend](http://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/screenshots/).

= What is planned to be implemented? =

Maxmind released a new API version (v2) with localized country names and a accuracy percentage. We will add it when it is out of beta.
