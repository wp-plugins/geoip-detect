Retrieving Geo-Information using one the Maxmind GeoIP2 databases.

== Description ==

Provides geographic information detected by an IP adress. This can be used in themes or other plugins, as a shortcode, or via CSS body classes.

= Features: =

* Provides these 5 functions: 
  * `geoip_detect2_get_info_from_ip($ip, $locales = array('en'), $skipCache = false)`: Lookup Geo-Information of the specified IP 
  * `geoip_detect2_get_info_from_current_ip($locales = array('en'), $skipCache = false)`: Lookup Geo-Information of the current website user
  * `geoip_detect2_get_current_source_description($source = null)`: Return a human-readable label of the currently chosen source.
  * `geoip_detect2_get_external_ip_adress()`: Fetch the internet adress of the webserver
  * `geoip_detect2_get_client_ip()`: Get client IP (even if it is behind a reverse proxy)
* You can use one of these data sources:
  * Free: [Maxmind GeoIP2 Lite City](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/), automatically updated every month (licensed CC BY-SA. See [FAQ](https://github.com/yellowtree/wp-geoip-detect/wiki/FAQ).)
  * Commercial: [Maxmind GeoIP2 City](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-country-database) or [Maxmind GeoIP2 Country](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city)
  * Commercial Web-API: [Maxmind GeoIP2 Precision](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-services) (City, Country or Insights)
  * Free (default source): [HostIP.info](http://www.hostip.info/) (English only)
* For the property names, see the results of a specific IP in the wordpress backend (under *Tools > GeoIP Detection*).
* You can include these properties into your posts and pages by using the shortcode `[geoip_detect2 property="country.name" default="(country could not be detected)" lang="en"]` (where 'country.name' can be one of the other property names as well, and 'default' and 'lang' are optional).
* When enabled on the options page, it adds CSS classes to the body tag such as `geoip-country-DE` and `geoip-continent-EU`.
* When enabled on the options page, the client IP respects a reverse proxy of the server.

See [API Documentation](https://github.com/yellowtree/wp-geoip-detect/wiki/API-Documentation) for more info.

= How can I use these functions? =

* You could choose the currency of the store based on the country name
* You could suggest an timezone to use when displaying dates
* You could show the store nearest to your customer
* You show or hide content specific to a geographic target group
* Etc. ... You tell me! I'm rather curious what you'll do with this plugin!

**System Requirements**: You will need at least PHP 5.3.1.

*This product can provide GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com.*

== Installation ==

* Install the plugin
* Go to the plugin's option page and choose a data source.

Maxmind Precision API support is here ... Try it out, I would tag it "experimental" at the moment.

= 2.3.1 =

The plugin was down for licensing issues.
All users must now opt in to use the database because it is licensed CC BY-SA.
Otherwise, the Web-API of HostIP.info is used.

== Changelog ==

= 2.4.1 =
* FIX: Revert IPv6 check. (Sorry for this. I thought PHP compiled without IPv6 would be esoteric.)

= 2.4.0 =
This is a major refactor in order to support multiple sources properly. The Lookup and the Options were seperated into 2 screens (accessible in the menu under `Tools` and `Options`, respectively.)

* NEW: Add a Cache for Web-API-Requests. Consequently, the function geoip_detect2_get_info_from_ip() received a new parameter "$skipCache" to skip this cache if not needed. You can check if the result is coming from the cache by checking $result->extra->cached (it is 0 when not cached, UNIX timestamp of cache event otherwise).
* This also applies to the shortcode API (`[geoip_detect2 property="extra.cached" skip_cache="true"]`)
* NEW: Error messages during lookup are now in `$record->extra->error`.
* NEW: Experimental support for the Maxmind Precision API.
* NEW: Shortcodes now also support fallback languages. (`[geoip_detect2 property="country" lang="fr,de"]`)
* FIX: Check for IPv6 support for PHP.
* FIX: Country data now also get timezones.

= 2.3.1 =
* NEW: API function geoip_detect2_get_current_source_description() (as there are different sources to choose from now)
* FIX: Show error message if PHP < 5.3 (instead of fatal error)

= 2.3.0 =
* NEW: Add HostIP.info-Support

= 2.2.0 =
* FIX: Update Maxmind Reader to 1.0.3 (fixing issues when the PHP extension mbstring was not installed)
* NEW: Commercial databases are now supported. You can specify a file path in the options.
* NEW: A country database (lite or commercial) database now works as well.
* NEW: License is now displayed before install.

= 2.1.2 =
* FIX: Show error message if PHP < 5.3 (instead of fatal error)
* FIX: Support multiple proxies (but currently only one reverse proxy)

= 2.1.1 =
* FIX: Notice "Database missing" should not show during/right after database update.

= 2.1.0 =
* NEW: A nagging admin notice shows up on every wp-admin page when no database is installed (yet).

= 2.0.1 =
* NEW: Using v2 version of the API.
See Migration Guide at [Github](https://github.com/yellowtree/wp-geoip-detect/wiki/How-to-migrate-from-v1-to-v2)
