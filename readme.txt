Retrieving Geo-Information using the Maxmind GeoIP2 (Lite or Commercial) Database.

== Description ==

Provides geographic information detected by an IP adress. This can be used in themes or other plugins, or via CSS body classes.

= Features: =

* Provides 3 functions: 
  * `geoip_detect2_get_info_from_ip($ip, $locales = array('en'))`: Lookup Geo-Information of the specified IP 
  * `geoip_detect2_get_info_from_current_ip($locales = array('en'))`: Lookup Geo-Information of the current website user
  * `geoip_detect2_get_external_ip_adress()`: Fetch the internet adress of the webserver
* You can use one of these data sources:
  * [GeoIP2 Lite City](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/)
  * [GeoIP2 City](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-country-database)
  * [GeoIP2 Country](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city)
  * Soon: [GeoIP2 Precision: City](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-precision-city-service)
* For the property names, see the results of a specific IP in the wordpress backend (under *Tools > GeoIP Detection*).
* You can include these properties into your posts and pages by using the shortcode `[geoip_detect2 property="country.name" default="(country could not be detected)" lang="en"]` (where 'country.name' can be one of the other property names as well, and 'default' and 'lang' are optional).
* When enabled on the plugin page, it adds CSS classes to the body tag such as `geoip-country-DE` and `geoip-continent-EU`.
* When enabled on the plugin page, the client IP respects a reverse proxy of the server.

See [API Documentation](https://github.com/yellowtree/wp-geoip-detect/wiki/API-Documentation) for more info.

= How can I use these functions? =

* You could choose the currency of the store based on the country name
* You could suggest an timezone to use when displaying dates
* You could show the store nearest to your customer
* You show or hide content specific to a geographic target group
* Etc. ... You tell me! I'm rather curious what you'll do with this plugin!

**System Requirements**: You will need at least PHP 5.3.1.

*This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com.*

== Installation ==

This plugin does not contain the database itself.

* Download the [free](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) or commercial version ([country](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-country-database) or [city](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city)) of the Maxmind database file.
* Ungzip it and upload it to your server. You could use FTP or the media uploader to do so.
* On the plugin page, set the absolute filepath to the mmdb-File.
* Check if it works: go to the plugin page and click "Lookup".

The GeoIPv2-Lite-database can only be updated automatically if you install the Github version of this plugin instead. See [Installation instructions](https://github.com/yellowtree/wp-geoip-detect/wiki/Installation) there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How exact is this data? =

Think of it as an "educated guess": IP adresses and their allocation change on a frequent basis.
If you need more reliable data, consider purchasing the [commercial version of the data](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city).
See [accuracy stats per country](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city-database-accuracy).

= Technically speaking, how could I verify if my visitor comes from Germany? =

Put this code somewhere in your template files:

    $userInfo = geoip_detect2_get_info_from_current_ip();
    if ($userInfo->country->isoCode == 'de')
        echo 'Hallo! SchÃ¶n dass Sie hier sind!';

To see which property names are supported, refer to the [Plugin Backend](http://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/screenshots/).

Or, add the plugin shortcode somewhere in the page or post content:

    Wie ist das Wetter in [geoip_detect2 property="country.name" lang="de" default="ihrem Land"] ?
